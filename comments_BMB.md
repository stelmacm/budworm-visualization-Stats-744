Fig 1: does temperature treatment actually perfectly divide the development order, or are the values ordered by devel time *within* temp treatment?

Fig 2: colours would be nice for visual appeal (if redundant)
Maybe use a theme that uses a background fill for the strip labels, to differentiate panels a little more?

log-2 scale on right side is nice

It looks like the higher-temperature values (30 and above) aren't binned/made into larger points?  This presumably has something to do with the weirdness in the experimental design?

Fig 3: nice colours
y-axis labels are a little cramped/busy (maybe unavoidable).
Would be nice to tweak arrangementof legends/strip labels some more (I know this is difficult!)
